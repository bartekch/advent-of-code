# Advent of code

https://adventofcode.com

My solutions for Advent of Code puzzles, in R with some pieces rewritten using Rcpp. Most of the time I've tried to stick to base R functions, although occasionally more advanced libraries hopped in. I've also try to build solutions that could be easily rewritten in other languages, although sometimes I am using some R quirks, like working with expressions. The code could probably be optimized in many places, but if the solution is working in an acceptable amount of time, I won't work on it further.


# Advice based on experience

* ALWAYS read the instructions carefully!!
* Take special care for possible straightforward optimizations.
* Take care of hitting R integer limit.
* Fail fast in recursive puzzles.
